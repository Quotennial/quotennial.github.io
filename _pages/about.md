I am a Data Engineer at Connected Places Catapult with a background in Computer Science and Economic Geography, based in London. Interested in using data to help people. Also have an seemingly persistent interest in causality, particularly using [DAGs](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) to communicate and isolate causal paths. 

My research background is in Economic Geography, particularly spatial distribution of innovation. Using patent networks, looking at the spatial distribution and local factors affecting innovation. Building a network of patent citations and using flow analysis to find the most influential patents. 

This personal blog will contain some data-science projects and creating data visualisations and testing out some cool libraries.  Hopefully there is something for everyone in these articles, whether it is the findings, programming, methods or use of datasets. I hope you enjoy reading and please let me know what you think :blush:
